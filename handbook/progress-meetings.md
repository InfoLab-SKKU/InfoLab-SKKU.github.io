In general, I have periodic meetings with all lab members to discuss their projects, usually weekly or biweekly. These meetings sometimes will be one-on-one and sometimes will be in small project teams. During these meetings, we will discuss progress, results, and/or problems with the continual goal of optimizing the efficiency and impact of lab members' work.

Although I am sometimes terrible at following them, I believe these best-practices make progress meetings most productive:

* **The lab member should prepare and share the agenda in advance.** The agenda could be very brief -- 3-5 bullet points -- and should take no more than 15 minutes to prepare.
* **These meetings should rarely be canceled or postponed.** Unless there has been sickness or vacation, it is equally useful to discuss things that are not working as it is things that are working.
* **Your flexibility is appreciated.** I often have one-off events that require coordinating many calendars (committee meetings, consortium meetings, etc.), and one-on-one or small team meetings sometimes need to be juggled to accommodate.
